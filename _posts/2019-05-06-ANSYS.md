AUV-IITK is a multidisciplinary team of IITK students involved in designing, manufacturing, and testing of a series of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), working towards providing a research platform for geoscientific research while preparing to compete in prestigious competitions such as NIOT, SAUVC, and RoboSub. 

After two successful prototypes, we have developed two AUVs, namely Varun and Anahita, and both of them have obtained the 1st Runners Up
position in NIOT-SAVe 2017 and 2019 respectively. The goal of these competitions is to promote autonomy in underwater vehicles.

## Flow Analysis using ANSYS 
<br>

One of the primary stages in designing and modeling of an AUV is the study of the motion of the vehicle and the subsequent visualization of fluid flow across its body.

Using ANSYS, we can produce 3D flow visualization, using which we can identify vortex locations, find streamlines of velocityfield and find the total drag force on the robot.

Using Fluent, we calculate the Drag vs Velocity and Torque vs Angular Velocity profile of the Vehicle. Using this data, we are trying to numerically compute the Hydrodynamic parameters that defines the vehicle motion underwater.

## Optimisation of Open Frame
<br>

The frame or the outer structure is one of the most critical parts of a vehicle; it holds all the components together and provides structural strength to the AUV. This year, in Anahita, we have implemented an open frame design.

To make the best-optimized frame, we used the Static Structural analysis of ANSYS Mechanical. Using this we compute the stresses acting on the plate at each location, by feeding in the forces that act on the body. Using this knowledge, we perform topology optimization to reduce the mass of the frame without compromising structural integrity.

Structural Analysis for most of the other components on the Vehicle have been performed, in order to optimize the design and material suitable for manufacturing.

Using the extensive features offered by ANSYS, our team was able to present a research paper, presenting a way to numerically compute the Hydrodynamic parameters of AUV`s at the IEEE OES Symposium held at the University of Porto in November 2018.

ANSYS has helped us a lot in deciding the key factors that has made our vehicle highly efficient and optimized. Our team aims to develop new vehicles for the years to come using revolutionary ideas, to dig deeper into Underwater Robotics. With the continuous support of ANSYS, we will be able to achieve greater heights and make noteworthy contribution.
